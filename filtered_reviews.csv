I've always had a great meal here in the past, but on this visit, I don't know, something was off.

I ordered the Kung Phad Noh Mai: Shrimp stir-fried with bamboo shoots, baby corns, carrots and mushrooms in oyster sauce. When it came, there were onions and green peppers mixed in, so I asked the waitress if this was, in fact, what I ordered, because I specifically chose something that didn't have onions in it. I don't have an allergy to onions, I just really detest them. If I can get something without them, so I'm not paying for something that I won't eat, I will. I think that makes perfect sense! Her response was that they just didn't put those ingredients on the menu! Ok, ok, I can pick them out (which is exactly what I did), but if they weren't on the menu, then they shouldn't be in the dish, IMO. What if I had a food allergy? 

I will go back, but guaranteed, I will be stating NO ONIONS IN MY DISH.
For anyone else, I guess you had better ask and maybe ask again if a specific ingredient is in a dish. For me it was just a food preference, but for someone else, it could be life or death!

The hotel is made up entirely of suites, and the base grade of suites is already very plush. Each has its own little living room and the sleeping areas are very divided from the main parts of the suite.

CORPORATE NEEDS: The extensive business offerings also come very much in handy, especially in the mid-grade suites and above...The Venetian staff became a true extension of my team's effort.

FAMILY / SOCIAL: Very accommodating of families as well as family / social functions. Lovely facilities and isolated ground areas for weddings and the likes. Depending on the suite level, there are all kinds of extras such as video libraries to keep all age levels entertained.

Our server Michael came over right away to greet us and offer us a cocktail & wine list. He recommended the cucumber cocktail. The drink was absolutely fantastic.. three of us ended up ordering it. He provided us with a menu tour and made some recommendations for a family style dinner. We decided upon three of his recommendations.. the ribeye (seared to perfection) came out as a first course with a side of mushrooms on a steaming hot skillet. The juices in each were delicious and I could tell my family was blown away. The next course was the neo toyko roll, the lima roll, and a side of Peruvian corn. We were getting full but Michael surprised my aunt Mary with a Happy Birthday pop-rocks cake pop and a samba split to share. THANK YOU MICHAEL from the bottom of my heart. You are truly an asset to this company, and you made the entire experience the reason why I continue and will always continue to be a sushi samba fanatic. Thank you :)"'0'dD0gZpBctWGdWo9WlGuhlA

I really enjoy the different food and flavor profiles from eating eastern cuisine, with Indian and Thai being my favorites. The complexities and layering of flavors and taste are amazing. Chada Thai delivers those things with vibrant balance and lives up to it's well deserved reputation. My GF and I arrived around 5:30 on a Tuesday evening.

SERVICE -

Considering the day and time, seating was quite available and there was no waiting. We ordered a couple of glasses of wine and reviewed the menu. Our server and staff we always prompt and attentive.

FOOD -

We opened with a Thai Beef Salad (Nua Nam Tok) and Spicy Lemongrass Soup (Tom Yum Koong). Both were simply amazing and popped with flavors and complexity. I could write a page alone on the wonderful flavor layering with just the appetizers.

We ordered Pad Thai Hor Kai w/ chicken and the dish was wonderful. The noodles were moist and tender, not limp or soggy. Flavor balance was great with a slight spice and mild/sweeter finish. Great complement to the rest of our meal.

For entrees we ordered a whole Tilapia dish (Pla Tod Ka Tiem), a crab curry dish (Sen Mee Kang Pou), and a charbroiled pork dish (Moo Khum Waan). All 3 were staggeringly well made. The Tilapia was whole fried, crispy and not greasy at all, and the fish was moist and tender. Crab Curry was LOADED with pieces of real crab meat and has a smooth sweet open with a very spicy finish. The pork had a nice char, but again, the meat was very moist, tender and FULL of flavor.

ATMOSPHERE -

Chada Thai is a very small restaurant, so the space can feel a bit cramped and claustrophobic. With that in mind, if there are few patrons like there were this evening, the feel is more intimate. There is some bench seating, which for me is such a no no, but enough individual tables that you don't feel like your sitting in your neighbors lap.

All and all, the food is truly the star here and carries the establishment all the way to a top rating!! THIS PLACE IS A MUST!!"'2'bc8C_eETBWL0olvFSJJd0w

This use to be my annual music fest, who am I kidding thee best rave everrrrrr and still going strong! I loved it when it was here in LA! I wish they would come back here but hey its a great excuse for a road trip. I went to EDC LA until the last year they had it here. This is how a crowd get down and real. The music is always great and when the beat drops the crowd goes wilding. 
   I love making costumes for each day. It's really my favorite part besides the music. We get to see so much creativity come out of people. Always good vibes and awesome people.
  The last year in LA was crazy though, music was turned off in the main room for a long time, and vendors refused to sell anything until the music was back on. People were jumping from the seating area into the arena, on vendor tents. I guess they had a good reason not to hold it here anymore lol.
   Although it's no longer in LA. EDC is still thee most awesome rave and you can experience it in Las Vegas the city that never sleeps, just like ravers! LOL

A couple years later, we learned that an aquarium was added, so we went to see just that. Wonderful! A stingray touch/feeding pool, otters, all kinds of different fish set ups.

There was a fancy restaurant too with beautiful tanks along the walls.

We went during a February afternoon. Just because it's Arizona, doesn't mean February is warm....we opted to sit inside, but since the entire back of the restaurant is open air, it was pretty much like sitting deep inside a park gazebo, with the wind blowing in every so often creating a slight chill. I'm not complaining (well, I am just a little bit), but be forewarned that you may need some sort of sweater or cover-up even if you choose to sit inside.

I ordered the ""Grilled Chicken Sandwich with Green Chiles, Tomatoes, Cheese and Fries"" and a coke. There were actually onions and lettuce involved, but I didn't eat those or the tomato. I thought the sandwich was pretty tasty; the chicken was cooked perfectly and the green chiles really added that special something to the sandwich. The fries were thick, not thin, and were tasty as well. Refills on soda were free.

For dessert, we ordered the  ""Campfire S'mores"". There were enough ingredients to make 6 s'mores; more than enough for our party of four. Arriving in a cast iron muffin pan, it came with a small can of portable gel that was pre-lit, thus creating the roasting fire. There were wooden skewers for the marshmallows, and plenty of chocolate and graham crackers to go round. It was a fun and delicious concept.

This place is also known as the Packer Bar, and there is a small area near the front of the restaurant dedicated to the green and gold. While all sports fans are welcome here, I feel like they are just a little bit nicer to those who are devoted to Green Bay. If you feel they don't treat you well here, you can always go next door to the Steelers Bar........good luck with that.

Out back are a few corrals which hold cattle during bull riding events, but that wasn't happening during my visit. The back area is also pretty big and I think they hold church services back there for bikers on Sundays.

If you're a Cheesehead who finds themselves on the outskirts of Phoenix, head over to the Buffalo Chip. You'll feel like you never left home......almost!

I am so offended by the fact that this place eve DARES to call itself a bbq joint. The potato salad was filled with UNCOOKED potatoes. COME ON! You can't get POTATO SALAD RIGHT??? Then they give me these collard greens that were flavorless and CRUNCHY??? They are supposed to be TENDER AND FLAVORFUL! Now on to the spectacularly bland and suburban dry to the touch so called cornbread. UGH! Now to the best part. And I say best because I had to throw everything else in the garbage in disgust! The brisket. It was tender and very well marinated/seasoned. Everything except the sauce which reminded me of dark ketchup! Horrible sauce! Lastly...the baby back ribs. They would have been tolerable if they were soaked in a decent sauce. But they weren't so they reminded me of some ribs that should be sold prepackaged to truckers next door at 7-11. Truthfully, I am no race baiter or anything but if I go to a joint serving collard greens and get served by a crew of young high school girls the authenticity is going to be questioned right off the bat. Constructive criticism? Get some SOUL in your food. Spice it up! The girl at the front was sweet and more than likely family but you are running a business. I didn't so much as smell a HINT of bbq happening even when I placed my order. You expect to be punched in the nose with the smooth smell of smoke and sizzling meats hitting you before you even get to taste it! This was a watered down experience and that is being GENEROUS. There are no other places that serve bbq in my neighborhood so I hope they get it together.

Okay, it's not really tacky. It's probably the third nicest theme hotel on the Strip that I can think of (actually, there are only three themed hotels on the Strip that I can think of ). The first two being The Venetian and Paris. You could also include Caesar's and Luxor, but they're hardly an experience. Aladdin is closer to the latter in that the surroundings are themed, but the stores are not. 

They have an ABC Store here! Anything from Hawaii is awesome.

So, I've since tried Pot Liquor CAS a couple of times again since my initial review and have decided to re-rate them at 4 stars. My subsequent visits have been head and shoulders my first visit. The BBQ is really great, moist and flavorful. I am confident my first visit was isolated and I've experienced a truer version of what they have to offer. A couple of things, tho....

The Georgia Margarita still needs work. There's not much peach flavor and the grand marnier should be floated and not just shaken in. At this point is still just tastes like any other margarita.

The last time I was here was when flip phones were just starting to get popular....yes, I said flip phones!

Today, they have changed locations so that they are across the street somewhat from their old spot and they occupy the upstairs...what great people watching! 

The food is better than I remember, but, I'm not as picky an eater as I was back then either. I remember having had the Qabuli Murgh all those years ago. The dish stuck in my memory because there were carrots and raisins in it....a very odd combination to me, but oh, how it worked! It's still on the menu, but today I opted for something different.

We were a group of three....hubs, his sis and me. He suggested splitting an appetizer 3 ways and then sis and I splitting an entree while he got one for himself. I know, it sounds bad, but his sis and I have very small appetites, so this was actually a very smart way to go and we still ended up with leftovers!

We started out with the sampler platter which consisted of hummus, bulani (fried potato and scallion filled pastries), tabouleh and baba ganoush served with yogurt sauce. A la free chips and salsa, warmed pita bread with roasted pepper spread and cilantro chutney were brought out too. Tabouleh...... I get why people like it; it was very fresh, but raw veggies taste gross to me! I picked out the scallions in the bulani and then thought it was very good! The hummus was garlic-y goodness and the baba ganoush was perfect! I've had it at other places where it was as sour as a lemon, but here? Perfection! Pepper spread, another awesome condiment I am newly in love with. Chutney? Don't love it, don't hate it, don't mind it. Sis and I split the Ginger Chicken: breast meat sauteed with ginger and garlic in a light curry sauce with artichokes. Light curry is definitely true! I am a curry lover and, although the dish certainly smells curry-licious, the flavor was very light and mild. Highly recommended for a curry newbie. The artichokes....cooked to perfection. No fibrous parts to chew on, at all. Let the accompanying rice soak up the sauce and enjoy! Hubs ordered Lamb curry: pieces of lamb leg with mushrooms and spinach in a light tomato curry sauce. There were also potatoes in it, but they aren't listed in the menu description. He let me try a little...another delicious dish! Everything seemingly melted in my mouth! Entrees come with either soup or salad. I chose soup, he picked salad. The salad is Romaine based, not iceberg, a definite plus, and hubs reported that the dressing, a very light cucumber concoction, was a nice change. The soup (Mashawa) had onions, chick peas, kidney beans, split peas, chicken and lamb in a tomato-y base topped off with a dollop of yogurt. How many words are there for delicious? For dessert? Baklava, or as they call it, Baghlawa. We split it three ways and our server, a very friendly, kind and funny Russian exchange student, went out of her way to find us the biggest piece. It was served with a piece of lemon candied in honey on top. Am I saying delicious too much? 'Cause that's what it was....yummy, yum, yum, yum!

I don't think there are any Afghani restaurants in the Milwaukee area, Kabul, so if you're ever looking to open a second location, come on over, we'd LOVE to have you!

SERVICE -

Hostess was very nice and prompt about her duties. Had a reservation for 6:30 and was seated within a couple of minutes. Things got kinda mixed once at the table. Our server was prompt, attentive, and very nice, but never introduce herself (I feel like that should be standard). 

Ordered water and a Woodford (neat) and both were prompt to the table, but the water is bottled and they charge for it. I feel like if that's the case, the option for tap at no charge should be offered. Throughout the meal we had to continue to ask for standard things, like plates.

FOOD -

Considering this the first time here for either of us, we ordered a number of things to try.One word can describe 95% of the meal... DRY!

We opened with the Cream Corn Fritters and they were prompt to the table. They were crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Very tasty and, unfortunately, the high point of the meal. Also, I think there may have been problems in the kitchen that night. It was over 40 mins between our appetizer and the entrees. I don't think our problem was isolated, because I didn't see any food coming out of the kitchen for the tables near us either.

For entrees, we had both the Memphis-Style Dry Rubbed Spareribs and the Mopped Baby Back Ribs. The ribs are huge and very meaty. However, there is no discernible difference between their dry rib and the mopped rib, which should be considered ""wet"".  Flavor was good, but both ribs were no where close to juicy and were very dry.

We also had the Smoked Chicken and the Texas-Style Beef Brisket. The menu says an order is ""1/2 smoked chicken"" which should be 4 pieces, but it's really 1/4 of a chicken since you get 2 pieces of chicken. The chicken pieces were small relative to the ribs, though they tasted good. The Beef Brisket was by far the biggest disappointment. The brisket had very little bark and no smoke ring. It was cut very thin and was dry as doctor's cotton. Literally, would suck every ounce of moisture out of my mouth.

For sides, we had the Hoppin John (DRY), Kale and Cashew Slaw, Mac and Cheese, Fries with Alabama Sauce, and the Cornbread with Honey Butter (DRY). They were okay, but neither of us ate more than a 2-3 bites of each.

ATMOSPHERE -

It's a casual and fun atmosphere for sure, very welcoming. We sat at a booth, which was HUGE and there seemed to be plenty of space between us and other guests. Nice place for a casual date before the movies or a night with family. I really liked the overall design and layout of the restaurant and could see it being fun for big groups of 6+. 

Plenty of TV's in the bar area, but not blasting noise all over the place. Background music was the same, loud enough to create atmosphere but you can still speak with your other guests.

OVERALL -

It was an okay experience, but I won't be rushing back for a ""second chance"" anytime soon. ""Meh. I've experienced better"" is an appropriate rating for Pot Liquor CAS. That's EXACTLY how I felt throughout the meal. Pricing level is okay overall, but not a bargain by any definition IMHO."'1'bc8C_eETBWL0olvFSJJd0w

We arrived about 20 minutes before him and ordered a couple of drinks and the duck fat sriracha wings while we waited. Oh, the deliciousness and, not overly messy like some wings....When he arrived, we decided to just order a bunch of small plates and share. It was a little tight, considering that we sat at the bar, but we made it work. Between the three of us, we had the Tuna Chips, Red Miso Seared Kobe, Gojuchang Grilled Octopus, and each of the steamed buns. We ended with a banana bread pudding type thing for me and a date cake type of thing for our friend.

Everything was delicious! The wings had just the right amount of heat, as did the octopus. We were able to taste the flavors through the heat, which many restaurants, IMHO, overlook in favor of simply having a spicy dish on the menu, because it's trendy. The kobe beef was very tender. The tuna chips were a little bland for me, but then I prefer thinner cut tuna as in sushi, versus thick cuts as in poke. The steamed buns were amazing and you really can't go wrong with whichever you choose. The chicken and waffle one was definitely interesting. My banana dessert thing came with a small ramekin of caramel, which made it even better. It was like small banana bread pudding balls that you could dip in the caramel, or drizzle the caramel over the balls and fork 'em. I opted for dunking because.....caramel. LOTS OF CARAMEL. The date cake, while yummy, just wasn't my thing.

All in all, the flavors of each dish held their own yet melded nicely with one another. Even with the spicy dishes, the heat didn't overpower the food. My husband had beers, my friend drank wine and I had delicious hand crafted cocktails. The service was very prompt, our server/bar tender was extremely helpful in explaining and recommending items on the menu, and was just downright friendly. Although this place is more of what I consider an upscale restaurant, the service (at least at the bar) was as if we were old friends who had stopped in after a long absence.

I would definitely recommend the Clever Koi and I will definitely be back.

We were walking around Scottsdale, popping in here and there at different establishments,  when our friend led us here. We sat just outside the restaurant so that we could people watch as we ate. We ordered shrimp tacos and the hot lobster roll. I had the Arctic Sea Dragon for a cocktail while the guys had beers. 

Everything was fantastic! The hot lobster, while on the pricey side, was perfect. The sweetness of the lobster meat was not covered up one bit by the sauce that it was marinated in. The shrimp tacos, while heavily battered, still tasted fresh. My drink was the perfect blend of cold and boozy. The place got busier the longer we sat there, but the atmosphere remained the same....relaxing and comfortable. At one point, one of the workers started turning the patio warmers on (thankfully), and at no point were we ever made to feel that we needed to leave because we had finished eating.

I don't know the reasoning for the closing of this restaurant, but I hope that one day, someone resurrects it, because I would definitely come back.

SERVICE -

The restaurant is intimate and always clean. The staff is friendly and professional mostly. Prompt and attentive I have been satisfied with their service from my first visit.

FOOD -

I've had several dishes here. Tikka Masala, Chana Masala, Vindaloo, etc etc. EVERYTHING has been great! The flavors are really well balanced and complex. The appetizers, are also great, Chili Chicken is my favorite! The naan is available in the usual flavors, and it's always crisp and flaky on the outside, soft, tender and chewy on the inside. REALLY GREAT!

I would suggest going for lunch. There is no buffet to try several items, but the ala carte entrees come with the naan of your choice and include basmati rice that's light and fluffy. all for around $10-$12

They have a full bar, so might as well make it a two martini lunch while you're there!

ATMOSPHERE -

The restaurant is intimate, yet colorful. There is booth seating on the perimeters and tables in the middle. There is enough space between all tables so that you don't feel like you're sitting in your neighbors lap and can feel comfortable to speak freely at a reasonable level with your company.

All and all, I would feel comfortable having a casual date or business meeting here (and have) without any concern. Well worth the visit!"'5'bc8C_eETBWL0olvFSJJd0w

As a Wisconsin gal, I had recently gotten into desert flora (can you say addicted, boys and girls?) and knew that this was a must see on one of my many trips to see the folks. 

For the most part, I knew what to expect. I had, by the time of this trip, been no stranger to book after book on desert plants......not just cacti, but other succulents and wildflowers as well. What I didn't expect was the size of this place and the beautiful groupings of the plants, not to mention the size of the groupings and even some of the plants themselves! You may think that you know what an agave looks like and how big it can get, but until you see a plant with a 10 foot diameter and 20 foot flower stalk growing out of it's middle, you have no idea! Or the 20 foot tall saguaro with 10 arms growing out of it, each arm approximately 10 inches in diameter? Yeah, those are things you have to see to believe!

Other than birds and a few squirrels, there wasn't much wildlife to be seen.

Just before leaving, we went into the gift shop where they sell the usual souvenirs: magnets, books, mugs, etc. Because this was a GARDEN, they also sold gardening stuff: gloves, a few small hand tools, pots....even seeds and plants. The prices on the plants was actually quite reasonable, but of the ones I wanted, they didn't have any small enough for me to stash in my luggage....they were all 10 inch specimens or larger. Everything else was, as expected, overpriced.

A nice little surprise was the Chihuly glass sculptures at the entrance to the garden, and then throughout, the various (not Chihuly) sculptures situated in the landscapes.

This is one of those places that you want to return to, but you need some time away so it doesn't bore you when you visit again. For me, it's been almost 10 years.....looks like I'm due another visit!

I have the patience of the Madonna - all right maybe more like the Material Girl - but I am pretty laid back. After my humbling experience in the wine industry, I've been much more appreciative of service industry related jobs. But when employees are not empowered to answer the most simple of questions, and we're checking in on machines with nobody around to handle luggage, well...it's a disaster waiting to happen. It's an unfortunate thing that is supposed to help in keeping costs down and help with efficiency - but there's been consistent problems with all of my US AIRWAYS flights.

Let's throw JFK airport into the mix to help maximize the disaster...we ended up in Orlando. Waiting for our luggage. Luckily our toddler was entertained with the luggage roundabout...because we waited through two flight arrivals to retrieve one bag. 

Family that met up with us for the 4th assured us US AIRWAYS used a really efficient delivery service...Apparently the lost luggage situation is pretty common.

My husband and I enjoy FLW's designs, a lot. Lucky for us, we live in his home state and have easy access to his buildings in WI and IL. On a trip out west to visit my parents near Phoenix, we planned a tour of Taliesin West.

You start off in the gift shop, where you check in (make reservations!!!!). There are all kinds of souvenirs to peruse, from post cards to books to jewelry, scarves/ties, magnets to furniture. When we checked in, their credit card machine was down, so they had to run our card through the old slider machine with the carbon slip. It wasn't until a month later, when our bill came, that we noticed there was no charge for the tour listed. We waited to see if it would appear on the next bill, but it didn't. So, yeah, we got the tour for free!

We took the most expensive tour at the time (@$160 for 2 people: this was maybe 6 years ago?), which I always recommend, as it always has the most info, especially if you don't really plan on ever returning. It included tours of most of the buildings on the property and a brunch/Q&A session with an architect who actually studied under FLW.

I don't want to repeat what other Yelpers have said, so I'm just going to say that both the buildings and the grounds were beautiful, as can be seen by the posted photos. Do NOT forget your camera, the scenery around this property in stunning!

The information given on the tours will differ between tour guides, as we discovered when we've chatted with others who have taken the same tour we did. One thing I noticed, too, was that the guides in Arizona didn't want to dish the dirt on Frank, like the guides in Wisconsin do. For better or worse, FLW was an eccentric and he did some things that were not considered acceptable back in the day. When my husband asked a somewhat ""provocative"" question, it was all the guide could do to not answer the question and steer the conversation in another direction. The one quirky Frank story they told was that when electricity was coming to the valley, Frank wrote a letter asking that no telephone poles be put where he could see them from his property. He didn't want the view ruined. Frank didn't write the electric company, mind you, he wrote the president of the United States! His request was denied.

Supposedly, Frank's ashes were scattered on the Taliesin West property, after his third wife had unknown accomplices haphazardly exhume Frank's body from his grave back in Spring Green. It is also said that these grave diggers may not have gotten all of Frank and that one of his feet was left in Wisconsin (at least that's what our WI tour guide told us!).

So, the verdict is, if you have even an inkling of interest in Frank Lloyd Wright, take the tour. Any tour. At the very least, stop in at the gift shop and pick up a book on the man; you can always come back.

My girlfriend and I have been dying to try this place for sometime, the planets line up correctly and we decided to give it a go... 

SERVICE-

We arrived at 5:30 on a weekday evening. the Hostess was friendly and somewhat prompt. as we we seated at our table, we noticed the Sushi bar was full but the dining room had vast seating. While the hostess selected for a very small table in direct sunset sunlight, we redirected her to a more spacious booth in a more comfortable area.

We were told the usual ""your server will be with you in just a moment"" ... 30 mins later no one had even taken our drink order. This wasn't because they were swamped, there may have been 8 tables occupied at the time, but because our server was more interested in being a social butterfly than attending to our table.

Once we complained, the Chef came out to apologize. Nice enough guy and I would've been alright with things except instead of acknowledging the poor service, he made the excuse for his staff that there had been a ""simultaneous seating"" which was FAR from true. At this point, I was truly looking forward to an exceptional and interesting meal. Oh the dreams of fools...

FOOD -

For Appetizers, we opened with the Grilled 5 Spice Lamb Chops and the Korean Street Tacos. Both were just okay. Not as much flavor as I was expecting/hoping for. Best thing was the salad that accompanied the Lamb Chops

Next we grabbed a couple of rolls of Sushi, The M Girl and a Geisha Girl. The sushi rolls were actually the best part of the meal and if by some odd twist of fate I end up in this place again, that is all I would have!

In the Rice/Noodles area we tried a couple of ""hard to get wrong"" basic dishes, Chinese Fried Rice and Pad Thai Noodles. Both of these dishes were horrible to the point of complaint. They were both flavorless and greasy/oily. Just really poorly prepared and we had them removed from the bill.

For entrees, we tried the Beef & Broccoli along with the Crispy Fried Tai Snapper. Both had potential, but the sauces used were just way too sugary and sweet. I swear, the sauce on the snapper tasted like a diluted, warmed, jam.

ATMOSPHERE

Most disappointing thing here wasn't even at our table, but directly in front of us. The hostess continued to seat patrons in a seating area where the refused to lower the blinds, though the dining area is surrounded by windows. We watched 3 sets of tables complain about the blinds while the 6:30-7:30 July western sun beamed down on them without mercy. No one in the establishment seemed to even care no matter what was said to them.

Enter this establishment only if want to extend a horrible night at the tables and make it even worse. Invested $150+ and gained the knowledge that I will never set foot in the place on my own accord again."'6'bc8C_eETBWL0olvFSJJd0w

Being from Milwaukee, I was expecting a rather drab, monochromatic marble building like our county courthouse. I was dead wrong! The interior is beautiful and colorful. The sun shining in, lighting up the different murals was stunning. Describing this place is impossible. A picture is actually worth a thousand words in the case of this building. I hope to come back someday for the free tour and for the farmers market on the square.

Service -

The hostess was prompt and our seating was immediate. Our server was pleasant and seemed knowledgeable regarding their menu and the offerings behind their theme.

Throughout our meal, our server and staff were attentive and responsive. Drink order was taken promptly and cocktails were on our table in good time. Our water glasses were maintained.

Food -

While I really enjoyed the flavors of the tacos. There were some missteps for me here. One is that I believe that chips and salsa should be standard at a premium priced restaurant like this one. Charging $3.50 for a ""salsa tasting"" is a bit cheap, when you are charging $14.50 for 4 small tacos per plate. 

We tried 4 plates of tacos Camaron (shrimp), Pollo (chicken), Carne Asada (steak) and Pastor (pork). They tasted great, with exception of the Carne Asada which we sent back.

Also, though ordered premium tequilas, the cocktails we a bit too steep given the  use of rocks glasses with heavy ice. 2 Don Julio Margaritas $32, 2 Fortaleza Margaritas $34... I'm sure you get the picture. 

Atmosphere -

For me, while the interior is visually pleasing, the interior is way too narrow and small. First of all, I have a personal grudge against establishments that use bench seating and this one uses it throughout. There are a few booths, but the entire restaurant feels cramped and claustrophobic to me.

Also, I feel that the dress code is too relaxed and doesn't reflect the pricing point. I shouldn't see flip flops and shorts abound in the interior dining room. For the patio area that's fine, but that should be regulated better.

This is maybe a Happy Hour place where you might meet for a drink at the bar and then proceed with the rest of your evening somewhere else. Overall, while the food and service were probably worth 3 stars, the headwinds of pricing and atmosphere keep it at 2 stars for me."'3'bc8C_eETBWL0olvFSJJd0w

As much as I disdain PH as a property, my experience with BurGR was actually pretty good! We arrived right around 5:00 pm on a Friday.

SERVICE -

We arrived early enough that there wasn't a wait. Hostess was friendly and prompt. The restaurant was quite full, mostly of people visiting the valley I suppose. The wait staff and support were attentive and responsive to assorted requests (like paper napkins). Drink order was taken immediately and our water glasses were never empty.

FOOD -

BurGR is a premium burger place. While I think ""premium"" and ""burger"" are somewhat conflicting, this establishment makes a solid effort to deliver a casual+ experience.

We opened with some apps; the Bao Buns, Fury Chicken Wings and a Chili Dog. The disappointment in this group the obvious one. Bao Buns ?!?!? At a burger place??? What was EVERY on my mind??? Definitely out of place on the menu and on the taste buds! The wings and the dog, however, are worth the order. Both were flavorful and well prepared.

We both had burgers, obviously, and they were really well prepared. Buns were toasted and soft, not too dry or stale. Beef was cooked to order and prepared perfectly; A+ here.

We ordered the truffle fries as a compliment. The fries were great, but give a thought to the dipping sauces as some of the combinations get a little funky. All and all very satisfied with the meal.
*small disappointment on dessert choices, only shakes are available*

ATMOSPHERE - 

This is a premium casual restaurant and, for me at least, I don't like seeing shorts, flip flops, baseball caps, and tank tops in the dining room after 5:00 pm. Granted, this is an establishment on the strip, but if that's your crowd move your price point to $7-$8 for a burger, not $13-$25.

The place is active and loud, so it's more suited for a group to meet before an evening out on the town or to precede an active date night. Energy is UP!

Last thing, be aware that the seating is unusually short/closer to the ground, than most places. I'm 6'2"" and it felt like my knees were practically in my chest. Not horrible, but ...unusual. 

All and all, I invested $148+ tip and had an ""ok"" evening. I would go back with friends from out of town and maybe sit at the bar on the next trip."'0'bc8C_eETBWL0olvFSJJd0w

There's lots to see for both kids and adults. The pool is huge and really nice with a lazy river, lots of bridges, tents for groups, and watertoys. Sadly, it was raining the day we were there so I didn't actually get to go in. MGM wouldn't be MGM without the lions. You can walk under their glass floor and see more of their glory than you ever wanted to. 

We ate at The Grand Wok and Sushi Bar, an Asian restaurant (duh), and 'Wichcraft, the sandwich place on the corner. Though I was really surprised by the authenticity and great taste, we probably wouldn't have eaten at Grand Wok had we not been provided meal vouchers (""not without coups, baby..."" ahhaha, Dane Cook is hilarious*...). The cool folks at 'Wichcraft gave us a free cookie as a consolation for selling-out on a sandwich. Prices at both of these places aren't life-threatening. Also, Emeril has a restaurant here... and he is freaking awesome. They fly their fresh fish in via plane everyday, and you will pay the price. Rainforest Cafe is great for kids.

Check-in pissed me off. They have no formal line, so people kept cutting in front of me. If ever I felt compelled to kick an old granny in the groin, it was then. Express check-out was as easy as filling out a card (actually, it was exactly ""filling out a card""). I would gladly stay here again.
